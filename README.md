IsPrime v0.9 by LukeLane1984

I started coding with Python just a few weeks ago.
As a beginner I thought that, writing a script that can calculate
whether a certain number is a prime number or not, might be an
interesting challenge and fun project.

I have done some other projects before, some of which I might also
put on GitHub after cleaning up the code a little.

This script probably isn't very useful at all for most other people,
but maybe a few other beginners will find it helpful, since I've written
comments into the code explaining the what, how, and why.

So if this helps someone in someway, great! If not, that's OK.
We all have to start somewhere.

Regards,

Luke Lane
